# 12MonthsML
This repository guides you to master in Machine Learning in 12 months.

## Prerequisites

1. This repository is designed *for freshers*. It covers all the basis required you to move further in ML ocean.
2. You would need to spend **minimum 10 hours per week** to complete this course.
3. This repository is completely designed with open source courses and youtube tutorials.


## Month-1 - Mathematics 

## Week-1 - Linear Algebra

  **1. Essense of Linear Algebra :** [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&index=1&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) 
  
  This series of videos from **3Blue1Brown** provides a graphical explanations for Linear Algebra concepts. This will give you a basic understandings about Linear Algebra and it is good to start with these videos before you proceed with actual Linear Algebra courses.
  
  This series have 14 videos and length of each video is 10-12 mins.

	Chapter 1 - Vectors, what even are they
	Chapter 2 - Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors
	Chapter 3 - Linear transformations and matrices   
	Chapter 4 - Matrix multiplication as composition  
	Chapter 5 - Three-dimensional linear transformations
	Chapter 6 - The determinant   
	Chapter 7 - Inverse matrices, column space and null space   
	Chapter 8 - Nonsquare matrices as transformations between dimensions
	Chapter 9 - Dot products and duality   
	Chapter 10 - Cross products   
	Chapter 11 - Cross products in the light of linear transformations   
	Chapter 12 - Change of basis   
	Chapter 13 - Eigenvectors and eigenvalues   
	Chapter 14 - Abstract vector spaces   
   
   >**Did you notice?** - Animation in these video series. These videos are created based on the **manim** animation engine which was created by Python. If you have more time, you can play with this engine. This link is having sample code and reference code used for these videos. [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).
